Few places can be as striking as the salt flats in Tamil Nadu’s port town of Tuticorin. On these vast expanses of land that seem to extend to the horizon, heaps of powder-white substance dot the landscape. Just when the mind starts to believe that this is the start of a snowy winter getaway, the scorching heat and humid air strongly suggest otherwise — this is not the Himalayas and a closer look shows you that what seems like snow is actually freshly-extracted natural salt.
